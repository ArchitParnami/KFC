History & Motivation
It was 2012, the memes were new to my generation. Memes were fad and everyone was talking about them. At the same time the budding programmer inside me who only knew C programming found a small hack which would let users to send small preview of images in facebook chat(In 2012!) with a help of a code. The code was the facebook image id put inside double square brackets.
I had to do something about it! What followed next was a great experience. These were the next steps:
  
  1. Find a way to upload hundered's of images on facebook.
  2. Fetch ID of each facebook image and encode them into sqaure backets.
  3. Write a program to translate user input into codes which will appear as images on facebook chat.
  4. Learn to use an installer to distribute your application.

Ragging programmer inside me spent a night to learn autohot key to automate task 1 & 2.
The next two days were spent completing the task 3. The 5th day in launching & marketting this fun little  project.

Unware of how to use databses, the newbie coder inside me with the little knowledge file handing in C wrote this 928 line of disastrous application in one single file! :D
 
Why the name KFC - Kolaveri facebook chat?
At the time - this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR12Z8f1Dh8 was another fad. Over 122 Millon views already! I wanted something catchy and my brain child couldnt think of anything else. Hence the name KFC - Kolaveri facebook chat :|
